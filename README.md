# ANN_Deep_neural_network
1. Used Keras to create an ANN predicting with high accuracy.
2. Used scikit-learn to predict the survival of passengers in the data. Applied necessary data splitting, cross-validations, grid searches to tune the models.
  - Classification model based on algorithms from scikit-learn (e.g. logistic regression, possibly regularized, Support Vector Classifier, etc.).
  - Ensemble model (e.g. random forest or similar)
